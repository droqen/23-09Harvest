A pair of mods for my `a_foggy_scene`

- [...] Just get a scene working using FPS assets

        Importing the .fbx was not working right; it had its
        rotation pivot point somewhere very far away! I re-
        exported it in blender.

        Also, I can't figure out how to import textures or
        normals or anything like that?

        ...

        OMG lol is this some sort of prank? the .glb file in
        bldg_maze/assets imports as a tiny tiny speck hahahahaha

- [x] Used Dan Hunter's assets instead, and my Godot scene loader.
        
        Worked *great*!!!
